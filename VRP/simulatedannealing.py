class SimulatedAnnealing:
    """
        Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic technique that has been
        extensively studied in regard to its performance when applied to the
        Vehicle Routing Problem.
        The technique derives its name from the metallurgical process
        of annealing, whereby a piece of metal (or in fact any material of
        crystalline atomic structure) is heated to a critical point where the
        atoms inside the material can reform into a new crystalline structure
        and is then allowed to slowly cool as new crystals develop.
        The algorithm is analogous to the physical process.  The algorithm
        starts at a high "temperature" and each iteration of the process
        "cools" the temperature down until a specified temperature is reached.
        During each iteration, a set of solutions are generated that are
        altered slightly from the current solution.  These related solutions 
        are referred to as "neighbors."  The steps to generate neighboring
        solutions are independent of the Simulated Annealing metaheuristic, but
        it is important that each neighbor is a single, reversible step change
        away from the current working solution.
        Each iteration, once a neighborhood of solutions is generated,
        the cost difference between the current solution and a neighbor
        solution is calculated.  If the neighbor solution has a lower cost,
        it is automatically accepted.  If the neighbor solution cost is greater
        than the current solution, it can still be accepted according to the
        probability e^(-delta_cost/temp).
        Thus, there are two stages that the algorithm moves through as the
        temperature decreases.  At hotter temperatures, the algorithm is in an
        "exploratory" stage where it readily accepts worse solutions in an
        attempt to escape local minima costs.  At colder temperatures the
        "exploitative" stage begins, and the algorithm attempts to optimize
        within the bounds of the local minima that it currents finds itself in.
        As with other heuristics, there is no guarantee that the global
        optima will be found.
